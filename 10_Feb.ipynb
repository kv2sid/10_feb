    "Where, filename is the name of the file. And mode is  a string, which is used to open the file in diffrent types of modes. The different types of modes in the file are.\n",
    "1. 'r' : Read mode is use for reading the file only.\n",
    "2. 'w' : write mode is use for writing the file only.It is use to write the existing file only. if the file is not available then it will create a new file.\n",
    "3. 'a' : append mode is use for opens a exising file to writing. But appends to the end of the file instead of overwriting it.\n",
    "4. 'x': Exclusive creation mode. Creates a new file, but only if it doesn't already exist. If the file exists, an error will be raised.\n",
    "5. 'b': Binary mode. Opens a file in binary mode, which is used for non-text files like images or audio.\n",
    "6. 't': Text mode (default mode). Opens a file in text mode, which is used for text files like .txt, .csv, etc.\n",
    "We can also combine modes by using a + symbol. For example, 'r+' will open a file for both reading and writing.\n"
